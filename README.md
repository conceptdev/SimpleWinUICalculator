# SimpleWinUICalculator (for Surface Duo)

Inspired by a [tweet by @DavidOrtinau](https://twitter.com/davidortinau/status/1365456677277941766) about a [Xamarin.Forms Calculator sample](https://t.co/lOvLD3uwb8?amp=1). His example was adapted for Surface Duo [here](https://github.com/conceptdev/SimpleCalculator).

[@theNickRandolph](https://twitter.com/thenickrandolph/status/1369418578458460167) tweeted a [WinUI version on Uno platform](https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/simple-winui-uno-calculator/).

This repo contains a dual-screen enhanced fork of the _Uno platform version_ that runs on Surface Duo, using the TwoPaneView layout control:

**Single screen** - behaves like the source app

**Spanned dual-portrait** - uses second screen as a history

**Single screen landscape** - adopts the same split as the spanned version and adds the history
